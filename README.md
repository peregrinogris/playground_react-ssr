## React SSR Playground

This repo is just a playground for actually implementing from scratch a React
app with Server Side Rendering (SSR). Here you'll find the following
technologies:

  * [React](https://ahfarmer.github.io/emoji-search/)
  * [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
  * [Babel](http://babeljs.io/)
  * [ESlint](http://eslint.org/)

The app itself is useless, but it helped me to get a better hold of how all
those technologies worked together.

If you follow commit by commit you should be able to see the different stages
this app went through when adding each of the mentioned techs.
